# 3D Avatar Creator

## Introduction
In this project, we aim to create a user-friendly web application using WebGL that allows users to design and customize their own 3D avatars. The application will offer a range of options for facial features, body types, hairstyles, clothing, and accessories. Users will be able to interact directly with the avatar in 3D space, adjusting its appearance to their preferences.
